        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h3>Bearing fault diagnosis using convolutional neural network</h3>
        <p>
            Implemented CNN for diagnosing faults of rolling element bearings by transforming 1-D
            vibration signals into 2-D images and exploiting the effectiveness of CNN in image
            classification.
            Achieved accuracy in the CWRU bearing dataset.
            Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for model development and evaluation.
        </p>
        <h3>Predicting Travel Mode of Individuals by Machine Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Aimed to understand what mode of transport employees prefer to commute to their office.
            Developed a model to predict whether or not an employee will use a car as a mode of
            transport and which variables are significant predictors behind this decision.
            Utilized Python and Scikit-learn for data analysis, preprocessing, and model development.
        </p>
        <h3>Transportation Problem using Linear Programming in Python</h3>
        <p>
            Used Python PuLP to solve transportation problems using linear programming.
            Solved the problem of transporting goods from source warehouses to various destination
            locations at minimum cost.
            Analyzed demand quantities, supply quantities, and the cost of shipping from source and
            destination.
